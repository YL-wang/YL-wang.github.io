I am a Ph.D. candidate in the College of Artificial Intelligence at Jilin University, supervised by Associate Professor [Xin Wang](https://xinwangjlu.github.io/), focusing on large-scale graph representation learning. Previously, I participated in a CSC joint training program at Griffith University(2023.11â€“2024.11), collaborating with Professor [Shirui Pan](https://trust-agi.github.io/author/shirui-pan/) (ARC Future Fellow) on out-of-distribution graph detection and graph prompt learning. Currently, I am in the final stages of completing my Ph.D.

My research encompasses large-scale node classification, molecular graph classification, and graph OOD detection and generalization. I specialize in techniques such as contrastive learning, sharpness-aware minimization, information bottleneck, adversarial learning, prompt learning, and diffusion models. I aim to develop scalable and robust machine learning algorithms to address complex challenges in graph-based applications.
